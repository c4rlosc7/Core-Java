# Arrays, Strings and Hash Tables

## Arrays

An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.

## Strings

Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters. In the Java programming language, strings are objects. The Java platform provides the String class to create and manipulate strings.

## Hashtables

The Hashtable class in Java is one of the oldest members of the Java Collection Framework. A hash table is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, with a unique key for each value. In a hash table, data is stored in an array of list format, with a distinct index value for each data value.
